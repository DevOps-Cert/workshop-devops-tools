# DevOps Tools Workshop

This workshop is designed to help you start or improve your knowledge of working in a *DevOps environment*. 

The goal for this workshop is to prepare a fully working set of tools that will provide you the *DevOps environment*. For simplicity reasons some of the tools will be setup locally while others will be public/online.

## What is DevOps

*First rule of DevOps, there are no rules*. You will not find a single or an exact definition for *DevOps*, just try to google it and you will see. In my opinion that's the way how it should be. *DevOps* is dependent on a team and how that team performs, so in this sense every team will have its own definition.

With that being said, ***DevOps*** or ***Engineering Agility*** as I like to call it, is ***Agile 2.0*** because it's all about being agile in a fast and highly competitive world by taking advantage of technology and engineering best practices to easily adapt to change.

**Engineering Agility** = **Culture** + **Technology** + **Best Practices**
